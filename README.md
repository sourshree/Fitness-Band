# Fitness-Band
Embedded Systems Development:
**Developed firmware for ESP8266 microcontroller board using Arduino IDE for embedded systems programming.**

**IoT (Internet of Things):**
Implemented IoT functionality to connect the ESP8266 device with the Blynk platform for remote monitoring and control of sensor data.

**Sensor Data Acquisition:**
Acquired sensor data (e.g., heart rate sensor, pulse sensor) using analogRead function and processed it for further analysis.
Networking and Communication Protocols:

**Configured and connected the ESP8266 device to a Wi-Fi network using the ESP8266WiFi library, enabling communication with the Blynk cloud server over the internet.**

**Blynk Integration:**
Integrated the Blynk platform with the ESP8266 device using the BlynkSimpleEsp8266 library for real-time data visualization and control through the Blynk mobile app.

**Event Logging and Notification Handling:**
Implemented event logging and notification handling logic to track user-defined events (e.g., low steps, milestones reached) and send notifications through the Blynk platform.

**Analog and Digital Signal Processing:**
Processed analog sensor signals (e.g., PulseSensorPurplePin) for heartbeat monitoring and digital signal processing to detect threshold crossings.
Timer and Interrupt Handling:

**Utilized timers and interrupts (e.g., BlynkTimer) for scheduling periodic tasks (e.g., data logging, notification checks) and interrupt-driven event handling.**
